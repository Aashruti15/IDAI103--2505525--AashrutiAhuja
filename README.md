ArtRestorer AI is a text-based generative AI application that provides ethical, historically informed restoration guidance for damaged artworks. It helps students, museums, and researchers analyze cultural heritage while respecting authenticity and preservation principles.


# Problem Understanding & Solution Design
The current project aims at the creation of a Generative AI-based web-based application named ArtRestorer AI that assists museums, historians, and restorers to digitally recreate damaged artworks by providing descriptive textual data. There is a lot of fading, erosion and loss of portions of historical artworks and the traditional restoration process is very demanding and time consuming.
The idea is to develop a Streamlit Web-based application using which users will be able to input information on artwork including the style of art, the name of the artist, date and description of damage. The AI then comes up with culturally correct restoration concepts, symbolic interpretations, and story explanations.
The solution will foster cultural conservation and ensure that knowledge of restoration has been made available to students, researchers and heritage institutions. It is the solution to the gap between the modern technology and the historical conservation.


# Research Findings

Conventional restoration of art also entails:
1.Learning artistic style and brushwork.

2.A study of historical context.

3.Equalling colour schemes and texture.

4.Drawings on missing parts of a work of art.

Generative AI models can simulate these processes using descriptive prompts. AI can:
1.Propose stylistic restorations.

2.Get culturally sensitive interpretations.

3.Give accounts of restoration.

4.Analyse artistic periods

It was found out that AI assists in accelerating restoration planning and making it more accessible to non-experts.
